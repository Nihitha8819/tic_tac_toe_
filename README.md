## 📌 About the Game

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic 2-player game where players take turns marking a square with their symbol (`X` or `O`). The objective is to get three of your marks in a row—**horizontally**, **vertically**, or **diagonally**—before your opponent does. If all the cells are filled and no one wins, the game ends in a draw.

This project replicates the game in a **modern web-based interface** with an intuitive user experience.
